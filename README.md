# Getting Started

Create a ToDo app on codepen, github repo, or codesandbox using whatever javascript framework you’re comfortable with.

Connect to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/ to pull ToDo’s. Allow todo’s to be filtered by status: open or closed using the tabs in the
header and filtered by title using the search bar.

The FAB button is to be used to add additional todo’s. The form will slide up from the bottom.

Make sure only the todo’s section is scrollable.
